📝 To-Do List App (JavaScript Console Version)

This is a simple To-Do List Application created using JavaScript. The app runs inside the browser console and allows users to manage their daily tasks interactively.

🚀 Features

Add new tasks to your list.

View all tasks with their index numbers.

Delete tasks by specifying their index.

Quit the app at any time.

🛠️ How It Works

When you open the application, it asks for a command. You can type:

add → to add a new task.

list → to view all tasks.

delete → to remove a task using its index.

quit → to exit the app.

The app continues running until you choose to quit.

🎮 Example Usage

A user can start by adding tasks like “Buy groceries” or “Finish homework”. After listing, all tasks appear with their index numbers. The user can then delete a task by providing its index. The process repeats until the user types quit to exit the app.

✨ Future Improvements

Build a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS.

Add the ability to mark tasks as completed.

Provide an option to edit existing tasks.
